# Travel-React-Native-and-Firebase-Project

A React Native - TypeScript - Redux - Reanimated 2.0 - Firebase Project.

An application which its purpose is to allow people plan a trip to wherever they want in the world and connect with others with that same intrest.
In the app you can plan a trip, see others who have already created a similar trip around that time, connect and chat with them or on the other
hand create a plan yourself that others can see.

The app is currently in production and I am hoping to publish it in the future.
